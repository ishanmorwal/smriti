# Smriti - K.I.S.S note taking app

Built on [`tauri`](https://tauri.app), with [`Skeleton`](https://skeleton.dev), a UI Library for Sveltekit. Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Current Progress:
2024-07-03: Added main menu functionality.
> Quit Menu doesn't work, only the **close** option from the File Menu closes the app as of now.
